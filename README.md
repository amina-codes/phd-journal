Ok, I almost thought I'd skipped a week -- this is how already busy my mind is... But! Significant progress this week to the project onboarding with Unity and catching up with all of the technical details of the lab projects. Also met with my advisor 1:1 and discussed a plan for starting my funding applications. As always, need to get a gew things ready for those and also take a mental note about two personal projects happening at the same time.
